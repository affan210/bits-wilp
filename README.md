# Breast Cancer Classification App

## 1. Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning application that can classify breast cancer tumors as either **Malignant** or **Benign** based on diagnostic measurements. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. This project implements multiple classification algorithms to find the best model for this task.

## 2. Dataset Description
* **Source:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (available via Kaggle/UCI).
* **Instances:** 569
* **Features:** 30 numeric features (computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass).
* **Target:** Binary classification (Malignant vs Benign).
* **Key Features:** Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, Compactness, Concavity, etc.
